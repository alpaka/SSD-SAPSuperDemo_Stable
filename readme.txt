How to run the Demo:

***Essentials***
You need to have SAP GUI Installed (see PS wiki on how to ...)
You need to have Internet access (if you are with a customer on their guest WLAN, check if their firewall allows to call our SAP Instance)

***Make it smooth***
Open the "default_parameters.xlsx" in the project directory and adjust the Parameters
Use from "DEMO_DOCUMENTS" the "doc_samples" and the "email samples"
Create an asset for the SAP Logon Credentials on Orchestrator (see parameter in XLS)
     [It runs without assets, but you may lose a security showcase part]


***Restrictions***
Selectors in SAP all work with English text/masks. Please use English
Excel captures if opened in Protected mode and enable editing. Again, just in English
There is a bug in forms -> when you click 2 (or more times) on a checkbox field it looses the predefined content.

***More ..***
If you want to create your own SAP User - there is a document on how to ...

This is a co-production of the UiPath Central Europe - Pre Sales team!
